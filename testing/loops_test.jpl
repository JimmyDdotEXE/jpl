#JPL has two types of loops know as for loops and while loops.


#For loops take a Num value and iterate from 0 to the given number.

for 5:
	#'loop' is a variable within the scope of the for loop that acts as the iterator for that loop
	print loop

#For loops are nestable.

for 3:
	print ""

	for 3:
		#and 'loop' is always the iterator for the most recent loop
		print loop


#While loops take a Cond value and continue to run while that value is true.

int i = 0
while i < 4:
	print i
	i += 1

#While loops are also nestable.

int x = 0
while x < 3:
	print ""

	int y = 3

	while y > 0:
		print y
		y -= 1

	x += 1
