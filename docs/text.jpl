#JPL has 2 text types, char and string

char c = 'a'	#chars represent a single character and takes 1 byte of memory
char e = '\n'	#chars such as newline can be escaped

string s = "turtles"	#strings are a collection of chars




#JPL has string concatenation that combines text values into a string value

string concat = "turtles" + ' ' + "are" + ' ' + "cool" #results is the value "turtles are cool"
