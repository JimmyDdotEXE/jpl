#JPL variables are strictly typed
#variables can have type byte, short, int, long, decimal, bool, char, or text




#variable declarations need a type and a name
int x	#variables auto-initialize to a base value at declaration. x has value 0 here

int y = 5	#variables can be initialized at declaration. y has value 5 here




#variables that have previously been declared can be referenced by name
x = y + 1	#x now has value 6
